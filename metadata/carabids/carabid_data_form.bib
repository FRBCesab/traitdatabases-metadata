	abstract = {1. Functional diversity ({FD}) metrics are increasingly used in ecological
 research, particularly in studies of community assembly and ecosystem
 functioning. However, studies using {FD} metrics vary greatly in the
 intensity by which ecological communities were sampled and it is largely
 unknown how sensitive these metrics are to low sampling intensity
 (undersampling). 2. Here, we used a combination of simulations with
 theoretically assembled communities and three comprehensive, independent,
 empirical datasets on plant, ground beetle and bird communities to
 investigate the sensitivity of nine commonly used {FD} metrics to
 undersampling. 3. Simulations with both theoretical communities and
 empirical data showed that in a wide range of contexts, the measurement of
 various {FD} metrics requires a much higher sampling effort to reach an
 ‘adequate’ precision (defined as an r2 of at least 0.7 between different
 subsets of the same population), than that required for commonly used
 taxonomic diversity metrics (e.g. species richness), although the
 ‘accuracy’ (their deviation from the diversity value of a completely
 sampled community) of their measurements is not more sensitive to
 undersampling than species richness. We also found that some {FD} metrics
 (e.g. Functional Dispersion) are consistently less sensitive to
 undersampling than others (e.g. nearest neighbour distance-metrics).
 Problems of undersampling were generally most severe in datasets with high
 overall species richness and low overall abundances. 4. We found that the
 precision of many {FD} metrics is highly sensitive to undersampling, and
 more so than commonly used taxonomic diversity metrics. Therefore, to
 ensure reproducible results in functional biodiversity research, we
 recommend that thorough sampling designs are used to sample communities
 and that datasets originally collected for studying taxonomic diversity
 should only be used for {FD} when it can be shown that undersampling is not
 a major issue. In cases where undersampling is suspected or logistically
 unavoidable, {FD} metrics that are relatively insensitive to its effects
 (e.g. Functional Dispersion) should be prioritized.},
