  title: Carabid morphological traits
  description: "Carabid morphological traits. Column names: name_correct = species name; source_measurement = researcher who performed measurement; body_length = body length in mm; antenna_length = antenna length in mm; metafemur_length = length metafemur in mm; eyewith_corr = eye width in mm; note = note; resid_femur = residual femur length in mm (i.e. residual from linear model in which femur length is explained by body length); resid_eye = residual eye length in mm (i.e. residual from linear model in which eye length is explained by body length) resid_antenna = residual antenna length in mm (i.e. residual from linear model in which antenna length is explained by body length)"
