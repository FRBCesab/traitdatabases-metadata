  title: Traits of lizards of the world
  description: Geographical, morphological, ecological, physiological and life history data for the 6657 known species of lizards. Indication whether there are phylogenetic data associated with them, and their threat assessment, if they have one. Main types of variable contained – body size, ecological, thermal biology, geographic, phylogenetic and life history data Spatial location - global Time period – data are for species known from living, or recently extinct species. Most underlying data were collected during the 20th and 21st centuries. Major taxa – Reptilia, Sauria (Squamata, including Amphisbaenia but excluding Serpentes) Level of measurement.
